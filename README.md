# AutoTestScript

AutoTestScript is a simple bash script that run tests continuously.

It is made to work with reasonably small projects (not too many files). It is likely to be slow on projects that have a large number of files.

It currently only works on Mac OSX.

## Installation

2. Place it at the root of your project (or anywhere in your path) and chmod it to be executable.

## Usage

Just run the script.
